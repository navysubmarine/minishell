so_long is a small 2D game project developed in C language. The goal is to create a simple tile-based game using the MiniLibX graphical library. I chose to implement a stellar approach on the classic 42 game, where the player is an earthian looking planet 🌎, gathering satellites on its way to the black hole. All tiles and sprites have been made by me with the [pixilart website](https://www.pixilart.com/draw). In order to finish the game succesfully and close the tab you have to :

To be able to play the game you have to build the executable file with every dependency (here MinilibX and my own libft, which I have included) :

```bash
make
```

And then run it with a .ber map, I have provided some in my maps/ folder, you can make your own or you can use a [map generator](https://github.com/ELmounikor/42-So_long-random-map-generator). 

```bash
./so_long maps/map1.ber
```

I also used AI (chatgpt) to help me create a checklist of everything I had to do in order to complete this project, to explain to me how the xpm format works, and to debug/make sure the program was leak-free.
