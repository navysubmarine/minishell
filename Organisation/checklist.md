# Shell implementation 
## 1) Parser
- The Parser is the software component that reads the command line such as “ls al” and puts it into a data structure called Command Table that will store the commands that will be executed.

We will need two things in order to do that :
- a Lexical Analyzer = it takes the input characters and puts the characters together into words called tokens 
- a Parser = it processes the tokens according to a grammar and builds the command table

## 2) Executor
- The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one. Additionally, it will redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error if there are any redirections

## 3) Subsystems
- Environment variables : Expressions of the form ${VAR} are expanded with the corresponding environment variable. Also the shell should be able to set, expand and print environment vars.

- Wildcards : Arguments of the form a*a are expanded to all the files that match them in the local directory and in multiple directories .

- Subshells: Arguments between `` (backticks) are executed and the output is sent as input to the shell.
