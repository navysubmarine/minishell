# Shell implementation 
1) Parser
- The Parser is the software component that reads the command line such as “ls al” and puts it into a data structure called Command Table that will store the commands that will be executed.

2) Executor
- The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one. Additionally, it will redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error if there are any redirections

3) Subsystems
